# pedump

pedump is a command-line tool that helps you analyze Windows's Portable Executable files by parsing and printing the required information about them.

This project is currently a work in progress so not everything is supported, and it might be broken.

pedump might evolve into a library later, instead of just being a standalone command-line tool.
